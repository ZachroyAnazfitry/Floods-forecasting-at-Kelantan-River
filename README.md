# Floods forecasting at Kota Bharu,Kelantan
Machine learning models for flood forecasting on water level dataset at Kota Bharu,Kelantan.

## Project Overview
The effectiveness of water resources management especially for short term forecasting can be achieved through enhanced streamflow forecasting models. Streamflow forecasting model is an extremely important tool, used to understand multi-events that occur in hyrological processess. Some of its usefulness are to assess floods, manage irrigation water during drought season and  to identify river water potential.

The objective of this study is to develop a river forecasting model that will forecast daily river level data at JPS station located in the Kelantan River basin, named Jeti Kastam, Kota Bharu. The proposed technique to be used in this study is Fuzzy Set Theory. 
 
The Drainage and Irrigation Department of Malaysia (DID) or JPS located six telemetric water level stations and four rainfall stations in the Kelantan River basin. Kota Bharu station was identified at the upstream of the Kelantan River and chosen for studies. The daily water level data for a period of 10 years was obtained from this department for academic/research purposes.
