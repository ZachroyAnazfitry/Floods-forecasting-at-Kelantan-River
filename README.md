# Floods forecasting at Kuala Krai,Kelantan
Machine learning models for floods forecasting using daily water level data at Kuala Krai,Kelantan.

## Project Overview
The effectiveness of water resources management can be achieved through enhanced streamflow forecasting models. Streamflow forecasting model is an extremely important tool, used to understand multi-events that occur in hyrological processess. Some of its usefulness are to assess floods, manage irrigation water during drought season and  to identify river water potential.
  
The Drainage and Irrigation Department of Malaysia (DID) or JPS located six telemetric water level stations and four rainfall stations in the Kelantan River basin. Kuala Krai station was identified at the downstream of the Kelantan River and chosen for studies. The daily water level data for a period of 10 years was obtained from this department for academic/research purposes.  

The objective of this study is to develop a river forecasting model that will forecast **daily river level data at DID/JPS telemetry station** located along Sungai Kelantan, Kuala Krai. The proposed machine learning technique used in this study is **Autoregressive Moving Average(ARMA) model, Decision Tree and Fuzzy Set Theory**.
